	<p>
		<strong><em>In Short: </em> </strong
		><em
			>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and
			store your information.</em
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons

		how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
		set out in our Cookie Policy.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		Our servers are located in United States. If you are accessing our
		Services from outside United States, please be aware that your
		information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our
		facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your
		personal information (see &quot;<a href="#infoshare"
			>WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</a
		>&quot; above), in United States, and other countries.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these
		countries may not have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as
		those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to
		protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy
		and applicable law.
	</p>
	<p><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong><em>In Short: </em> </strong
		><em
			>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
			purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required
			by law.</em
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
		necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a
		longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
		accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will
		require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
		of time in which users have an account with us.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
		personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this
		is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
		stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
		information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
		possible.
	</p>
	<p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong><em>In Short: </em> </strong
		><em
			>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
			organizational and technical security measures.</em
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
		measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
		process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
		internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect
		your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
		from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
		services within a secure environment.
	</p>
	<p><strong>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong><em>In Short: </em> </strong
		><em
			>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under
			18 years of age.</em
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
		years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
		18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
		such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
		information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
		will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
		delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
		have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
		support@tivolicloud.com.

			>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have
			rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
			personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
			account at any time.</em
		>
	</p>
	<p>

		however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
		before its withdrawal.

		unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right
		to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can

	<p><strong>10. DATA BREACH</strong></p>
	<p>
		A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
		collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You
		will be notified about data breaches when Tivoli Cloud VR, Inc. believes
		you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach
		may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental
		or physical well-being. In the event that Tivoli Cloud VR, Inc. becomes
		aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in
		unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Tivoli
		Cloud VR, Inc. will promptly investigate the matter and notify the
		applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having
		become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to
		result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
	</p>
	<p><strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
	<p>
		Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
		applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
		activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
		online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
		technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
		been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
		signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
		choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
		adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
		practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
